# BetterShot

**What will be used in this project:**
- Go (gui app)
- Node.js (web interface)
- Django (backend for website)
- NGINX (web server stuff)
- Prisma (easy development interfacing with a DB ie: postgresql, sqlite, or mysql)
- Bash (easy setup installation process in unix environments)
- MIPS (would be really nice to somehow incorporate it into app's architecture)
