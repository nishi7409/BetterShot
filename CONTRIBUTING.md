# Contributing to BetterShot

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/nishi7409/bettershot/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* CamelCase!!
* Tab for indentation
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
